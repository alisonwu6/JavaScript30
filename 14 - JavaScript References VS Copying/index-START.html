    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';  // it's reference to the original one
    // console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // copy from the original
    team2[3] = 'Wu';
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Wu3';
    // console.log(team2);
    // console.log(team3);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Wu4';
    // console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Wu5';
    // console.log(team5);
    // console.log(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;

    // console.log(person.age);  // 99
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
      number: 99,
      age: 12
    });

    // console.log('captain',captain);
    // console.log('captain2',captain2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
